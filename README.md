**Project Summary -**

**Abstract:**

The "Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering" project is an unsupervised machine learning initiative aimed at analyzing and categorizing the extensive content library of Netflix. The objective is to apply clustering algorithms to discover hidden patterns and group similar titles together, providing valuable insights for content recommendation and management. By preprocessing the dataset, applying clustering algorithms, and extracting features, the project identifies meaningful clusters of movies and TV shows. The outcomes of this project have practical applications in content recommendation, content curation, and content production strategies, enhancing user experience and platform performance.

**Summary:**
