#**Introduction**

This project aims to cluster the video content available on Netflix based on the companyâ€™s site data. Apart from aiding in the development of an efficient recommendation system, clustering the video content would also provide information about the type of content the company is interested in listing on its site. Thus giving an insight to content creators and filmmakers on the type of video content in demand.

#**Project Summary -**
##**Abstract:**

The "Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering" project is an unsupervised machine learning initiative aimed at analyzing and categorizing the extensive content library of Netflix. The objective is to apply clustering algorithms to discover hidden patterns and group similar titles together, providing valuable insights for content recommendation and management. By preprocessing the dataset, applying clustering algorithms, and extracting features, the project identifies meaningful clusters of movies and TV shows. The outcomes of this project have practical applications in content recommendation, content curation, and content production strategies, enhancing user experience and platform performance.

##**Summary:**

The "Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering" project utilizes unsupervised machine learning techniques to categorize the vast collection of Netflix movies and TV shows. By preprocessing the data, applying clustering algorithms, and extracting features, the project identifies meaningful clusters of titles sharing similar characteristics. The results offer valuable insights for content recommendation, content curation, and content production strategies, empowering users to discover relevant content and optimizing Netflix's content organization and delivery.
